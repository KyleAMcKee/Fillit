# 42 Project: Fillit

The goal of this two person project was to create a program that fits Tetris-like pieces together in the smallest possible square, in the fastest time possible. Our strategy for this project was to store all pieces in a 3d array and use recursive backtracking to find the optimal placement of all pieces.
